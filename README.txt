Simple guide to ML material you might find useful (ML_Links_N_Books):

1. File Links comprised of useful ML links and some papers as well. 

2. ML_Links_N_Books folder contains some books you can check out:
	a) Geron017_Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow_ Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems is the best book in my opinion
	b) Raschka015_PythonMachineLearning is also worth checking out
